My Thesis

This thesis proposes to expand the use of transfer-learning in mobile applications by attempting to tackle the face-recognition problem with the TensorFlowLite library, which is based on a mobile app (android platform). The success of this research is expected to provide specific information about the procedure for implementing the transfer-learning model using TensorFlowLite, as well as assisting industry professionals in developing facial recognition applications based on mobile applications to recognize the faces of criminals (android). This study should make it easier for future researchers and Android developers to use transfer learning techniques to a larger sector.
